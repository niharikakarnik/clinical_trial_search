# Clinical Trial Search!
I made the assumption that because the keyword search from clinicaltrials.gov was not providing good results I should not use the api created by clinicaltrials. 

Some considerations for how I would want to deploy this is a more production scenario. 
1. I was exploring using this model from huggingface: https://huggingface.co/allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased with the hope of creating an embedding for each trial based upon the keywords. To better search for related trials I could compare the embeddings created for each query with the embeddings assigned to the trial and recommend the ones closest/matching the expected results. This would completely remove the need for using openai to generate medical synonyms for each query & would provide results with closer values. 
2. In the case that the huggingface approach doesn't work or isn't relevant I'd want to optimize the search strategy used. Right now I am bruteforce searching the json file of each trial using the synonmys generated by openai. To optimize this search, elastic search would allow me to better search for each clinical trial. (it just seemed a bit out of scope for this project)
